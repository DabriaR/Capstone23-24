            <blockquote>The lack of black representaion in media continues to perpetuate
                harmful stereotypes. The underrepresentation of black individuals in 
                forms of media such as film, television and advertising has reinforced
               harmful narratives and racial bias. This perpertuation of negative stereotypes
               dates back all the way to late 19th century, during the Jim Crow era, where stereotypes
               were brought to the theatrical stage by blackface ministrel. This pattern continued 
               throughout movies in the 1900s, mammys, jezebelles, and aunt jemimah. The theme is 
               continued today through modern stereotypes that illustrate black people as "angry" or
               "lazy", causing the likeliness of white people to subsequently hold these stereotypes.
             In addition to this, black voices are silence through forms of animated media
                due to white actors being picked as voice actors for african american characters
                which is considered as misrepresentation.

            A study within the african american community about black american 
            experiences with news state that: 
<ul>
    <li>
    Almost two-thirds of Black adults (63%) say news about Black people
    is often more negative than news about other racial and ethnic groups; 
    28% say it is about equal and 7% say it is often more positive.
</li>
<li>
    57% say the news only covers certain segments of Black communities,
     compared with just 9% who say it covers a wide variety of Black people.
</li>
<li>
    Half say coverage is often missing important information,
     while only 9% say it often reports the full story.
</li>
<li>
    43% say the coverage largely stereotypes Black people, far higher than the 11% who
     say it largely does not stereotype. An additional 43% say both of these things
      happen about equally.
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    The survey asked Black Americans if they ever come across news that is racist
     or racially insensitive about Black people in some way. About four-in-ten (39%)
      say they see this kind of racially problematic news extremely or fairly often, 
      and an additional 41% say they sometimes see such news.
